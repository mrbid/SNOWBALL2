# SNOWBALL2
The GLFW version of Snowball.mobi with MSAA.

This is probably going to be a slow progress project as it's not a priority or a passion project of mine at the moment, essentially I wanted to try out [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and decided that porting [Snowball.mobi](https://github.com/mrbid/Snowball.mobi) to GLFW would be a good test case.

Generally I really like GLFW, although it has no default audio support like SDL has, GLFW feels like a better portable framework to be using for OpenGL. Also, audio support in SDL2 probably wont be as good as utilising [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/).

At the moment this is a direct port of the original Snowball game, but the plan would be to radically improve upon the old version.

## TODO
- GL Menu System
- Audo system
- Particle effects
- Smoother rotation transitions
- Better timings, use polynomial for snowball rotation speed possibly.
